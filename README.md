# Deep Variance Reduction
Source code from the experiments in [On the Ineffectiveness of Variance Reduced Optimization for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04529).

This code should be considered archival. Pull requests will only be accepted for bug fixes.

## Running
The reproduce_* scripts in reproduce/ should run in your cluster environment. Each script takes a one or several integer arguments which must be swept over to produce the full set of data for use by the plotting scripts.
